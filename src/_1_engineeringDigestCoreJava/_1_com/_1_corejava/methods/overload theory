1) In method OVERLOADING we can have multiple functions but having "different parameters"..
2) sum(int a, int b) --> Method signature
3) We can have same method signature with different parameters known as method overloading, and can have different return types;
    For eg:
    * void sum(int a, int b);
    * int sum(int a, int b, int c);
    * float sum(int a, flaot b);
    * double sum(int a, double b);
