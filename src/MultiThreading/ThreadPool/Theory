Thread Pool -- Collection of pre-initialized threads.

* bina thread pool ke thread create honge destroy honge baar baar ,
  to eski vajah se bhi to memory jaa ri hai

-----why required ??-----
 1) Resource Management
 2) Response Time (response time badh jaaega)
 3) Control Over Thread Count (kitne hum maximum number of threads create kar sakte hai uspe rok laga deta hai.)

-----Executors Framework in Java-----

The Executors framework was introduced in Java 5 as part of the java.util.concurrent
package to simplify the development of concurrent applications by abstracting away
many of the complexities involved in creating and managing threads.

It consists of three core interfaces
  a) Executor
  b) ExecutorService
  c) ScheduledExecutorService

-----Problems w/o Exe.Fram.-----

Manual Thread Management
1) Resource Management (resource management nahi hota dhang se)
2) Scalability (jiski vajah se scalabilty achieve nahi ho ri hai, means agar jyada
                req aaengi to ho sakta hai ki system baith jaaye)
3) Thread Reuse
4) Error Handling (jab hum manually sab karenge to jyada ghich pich
                    ho jaaengi cheeze, complexity increase ho jaaegi)
