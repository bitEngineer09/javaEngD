1) MULTITHREADING refers to the ability to execute multiple threads within a single process concurrently.

2) A web browser can use multithreading by having separate threads for rendering the page, running JavaScript, and,
   managing user inputs. This makes the browser more responsive and efficient.

3) Multithreading enhances the efficiency of multitasking by
   breaking down individual tasks into smaller sub-tasks or
   threads. These threads can be processed simultaneously,
   making better use of the CPU's capabilities.

4) In a single-core system: -->
   Both threads and processes are managed by the OS scheduler
   through time slicing and context switching to create the illusion of simultaneous execution.


5) In a multi-core system: -->
   Both threads and processes can run in true parallel on
   different cores, with the OS scheduler distributing tasks across the cores to optimize performance.
