1) In a multithreaded environment, threads often need to communicate
   and coordinate with each other to accomplish a task.

2) Without proper communication mechanisms, threads might end up in inefficient
   busy-waiting states, leading to wastage of CPU resources and potential deadlocks.

3) Some methods for Thread Communcation -->
   i)  wait - ye bolta hai current thread ko lock kar do and wait
       karo jab tak dusra thread notify yaa fir notifyAll nahi chala deta.

   ii) notify - wakes up a single thread that is waiting.

   ii) notifyAll - wakes up all thread that are waiting.

These methods can only be called in synchronized area.
