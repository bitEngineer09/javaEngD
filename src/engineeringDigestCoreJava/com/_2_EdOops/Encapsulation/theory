1) Encapsulation is DATA HIDING.
2) Class me do cheeze hoti hai --> properties/fields/instance variable & behaviour
3) Note -> class ke vars ko instance vars & methods ke vars ko local vars kehte hai.
4) To achieve encapsulation declare instance vars as private and methods as public.
5) Therefore to access data we need GETTER and SETTER methods for each fields.
