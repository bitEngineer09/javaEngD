LOCKING
a) Intrinsic --> These are built into every object in Java.
                 You don't see them, but they're there.
                 When you use a synchronized keyword,
                 you're using these automatic locks.

b) Explicit  --> These are more advanced locks you can control
(Manual Locks)   yourself using the Lock class from java.util.concurrent.locks.
                 You explicitly say when to lock and unlock, giving you more
                 control over how and when people can write in the notebook.
