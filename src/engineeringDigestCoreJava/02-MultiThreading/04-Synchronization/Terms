1) RACE CONDITIONS occur when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization.

2) MUTUAL EXCLUSION (Mutex) means only one thread can access a shared resource at a time to prevent issues like race conditions.

3) CRITICAL SECTION is a part of a program where shared resources (like variables, files, or databases) are accessed by multiple threads.

4) SYNCHRONIZATION in Java is a technique used to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources. It ensures that
   ,only one thread can access a critical section at a time, preventing race conditions and inconsistent data.

5) STARVATION happens when a thread waits too long and doesnâ€™t get a chance to run because other threads keep taking all the CPU time or resources.

Disadvantages -->
a) SYNCHRONIZATION me fairness ki guaranty nahi hai.
b) indefinitely blocking hoti hai.
c) interruptibility bhi nahi hai, matlab ki agar koi lock bht der se baitha hai to use interrupt nahi kar sakte.
d) synchronized ko pata hee nahi hai ki konsa read lock/ write lock hai.
